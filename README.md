## How it works
 
The Irdroid Alarm System App for Android is installed in the user’s smartphone and the Irdroid magnetic door sensor accessory (the Irdroid AlarmBug ) connected to the smartphone via the 3.5mm audio jack. Once someone opens the door/window where the system is installed the user gets notified via email and there is also a local notification with great psychological effect on the intruders (“Security Breach , Police are on their way!”)


## Application features:

* Local on-screen notifications

* High quality magnetic sensor accessory with a 3.5mm 4 pole Audio Jack connection.
* 4 screws for fixing the magnetic sensor accessory (the movable and not movable parts) / or adhesive tape fixing.

* Tamper protection (triggers alarm if someone disconnects the accessory)
* Easy installation - in less than one minute (just attach the Irdroid AlarmBug to your smartphone and start the App)
